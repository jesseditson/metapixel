.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This manual page documents briefly the \fBmetapixel\fR and \fBmetapixel\-prepare\fR commands\&. For more information check the README file included in the distribution\&.

.PP
\fBmetapixel\fR is a program for generating photomosaics\&. It can generate classical photomosaics, in which the source image is viewed as a matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which a matching image is substitued, as well as collage\-style photomosaics, in which rectangular parts of the source image at arbitrary positions (i\&.e\&. not aligned to a matrix) are substituted by matching images\&.

.PP
\fBmetapixel\-prepare\fR is a utility that needs to be run before metapixel can be used\&. It prepares your source images so that they can be used by \fBmetapixel\fR to create the actual photomosaic\&.

.SH "USAGE"

.PP
\fBmetapixel\-prepare \fIsrcdir\fR \fIdestdir\fR\fR has to be run first\&. \fIsrcdir\fR is the path to the directory containing the source images, e\&.g\&. \fI~/Pictures/Holidays\fR\&. \fIdestdir\fR, e\&.g\&. \fI~/\&.metapixel\fR, is the path to the directory where you want to store the rescaled images and the \fItables\&.mxt\fR index file\&. This directory should be created manually before running \fBmetapixel\-prepare\fR\&.

.PP
\fBmetapixel \-\-metapixel \fIinput\&.jpg\fR \fIoutput\&.png\fR \-\-library \fIdestdir\fR\fR is then used to transform an image (\fIinput\&.jpg\fR) into a mosaic (\fIoutput\&.png\fR) using the source images (described by \fIdestdir/tables\&.mxt\fR)\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
The options are described in the README file or by running \fBmetapixel\fR or \fBmetapixel\-prepare\fR with the \-\-help option\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.PP
The README file is included in the Metapixel distribution\&.
